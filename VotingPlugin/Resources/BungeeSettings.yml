# Global mysql data handle for between server commmunications
# This is NOT required for bungee voting to work
# This is still a WIP, use with caution
# This will create a different table then from users storing server info to process
#
# If you use this you need to enable this on BungeeSettings.yml on each server with votingplugin
# Make sure server name is set correctly in BungeeSettings.yml or this will not work correctly
# 
# Please use PLUGINMESSAGING for this, SOCKETS should work as well, but not fully tested
#
# This will make votes cache until time change has finished processing
# In the event a server is offline or time change fails, the time change process
# will continue after a set amount of time (in essense skipping a specific server)
# This will also respect blocked servers in bungeeconfig.yml
