# VotingPlugin – Special Rewards Configuration (SpecialRewards.yml)
#
# Quick-disable rule:
#   - To disable any reward section: set it to {} (single line) or remove it.
#     Example: FirstVote: {}
#
# VoteMilestones (NEW / Recommended):
#   - Each entry is evaluated on every vote.
#   - Triggers:
#       • At: <number|list|range>   (exact totals; supports ranges like 10..50 step 10)
#       • Every: <number>          (fires at multiples: 10,20,30,...)
#   - First vote note:
#       • The first vote total is 1, so use At: 1 for “first vote”.
#
# Limits (optional, per milestone):
#   - NONE (default)           : can trigger whenever it matches
#   - WINDOW_DAY/WEEK/MONTH    : only once per calendar window
#   - COOLDOWN                 : once per duration (30m, 12h, 2w, 1mo, 5000ms)
#
# Groups (optional):
#   - Use Group: <id> on a milestone to put multiple milestones into a selection bucket.
#   - Selection modes per group are configured under VoteMilestonesOptions.Groups:
#       • ALL     : execute all matched milestones in that group
#       • FIRST   : execute first matched milestone (file order)
#       • HIGHEST : execute “best” matched milestone (prefers AT > EVERY; higher values win)
