# VotingPlugin – Special Rewards Configuration (SpecialRewards.yml)
# Author: BenCodez
#
# This file controls "special" reward systems that are NOT tied to a single vote site:
#  • First vote rewards (ever / today)
#  • AllSites / AlmostAllSites daily rewards
#  • Cumulative vote rewards (every X votes)
#  • VoteParty rewards (server-wide goal)
#  • Milestones (one-time totals)
#  • Vote streak rewards (new + legacy)
#  • AnySiteRewards / LoginRewards / LogoutRewards
#  • Top Voter awards (monthly/weekly/daily)
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ✅ Rewards Enabled / Disabled
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# • To disable a reward section, set it to {} or remove it entirely.
#     Example: FirstVote: {}     (all in one line)
# • Rewards are only executed if there is something to give (commands/items/messages/etc).
#   Empty / missing sections are ignored.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 🎁 Reward Formats
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Rewards use AdvancedCore's reward format (Commands, Messages, Items, etc).
# Most servers can configure everything here without any extra reward files.
#
# Reward docs:
#   https://github.com/BenCodez/VotingPlugin/wiki/Rewards
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 🌐 Proxy / Network Setups (Velocity / Bungee / Multi-server)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# • Decide whether rewards/streaks should be GLOBAL or PER-SERVER.
#   - Some sections (like VoteStreaks) can be shared or split based on IDs and server setup.
# • Make sure each backend has a unique ServerName in BungeeSettings.yml.
# • Rewards are typically processed on BACKEND servers, not the proxy.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 🧠 Tips
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# • Use Ctrl + F to search quickly.
# • Setting a message to '' disables it (empty string).
# • Removing a config entry causes the plugin to fall back to its internal default.
#   (Only remove entries intentionally, as defaults may change between versions.)
