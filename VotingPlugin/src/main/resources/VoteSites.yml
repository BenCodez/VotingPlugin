# VotingPlugin – VoteSites Configuration (VoteSites.yml)
# Author: BenCodez
#
# This file defines:
#  • Vote sites (matching the incoming ServiceSite / serviceName)
#  • Vote URLs shown by /vote
#  • Vote delays used by /vote next (and optional vote-delay enforcement)
#  • INLINE rewards per site (no reward files required)
#  • Optional “EverySiteReward” (reward on every configured site vote)
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 📑 Quick Notes
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# • The VoteSites key name (example: ExampleVoteSite) is the internal identifier:
#   - Used for saving vote-site specific data
#   - Keep it short: NO spaces, NO dots
#
# • ServiceSite MUST match the incoming vote “serviceName” exactly.
#   - If votes aren’t being detected, check your console logs after voting.
#
# • Inline rewards are the normal setup for most servers:
#   - You do NOT need reward files/folders to run rewards.
#   - Reward files are optional organization only.
#   - Inline reward docs:
#       https://github.com/BenCodez/VotingPlugin/wiki/Rewards
#
# • Advanced reward systems (Top Voter, Milestones, Cumulative, AllSite, etc.)
#   are configured in specialrewards.yml (not here).
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 🌐 Proxy / Network Setups (Velocity / Bungee / Multi-server)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# • Votes are typically received at the proxy and then forwarded to backend servers.
# • Rewards are usually processed on BACKEND servers.
# • Make sure each backend has a unique ServerName in BungeeSettings.yml.
# • Keep votesites.yml consistent across all backend servers (recommended).
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 🧠 Editing Tips
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# • Use Ctrl + F to search.
# • Setting a message to '' disables it (empty string).
# • Removing a config entry causes the plugin to fall back to its internal default.
#   (Only remove entries intentionally, as defaults may change between versions.)

VoteSites:
  # VoteSite key
  # Used for saving data for votesites
  # Use a short name if you can
  # No spaces or dots
  ExampleVoteSite:
    # Enable voteSite
    # If false, votesite will not be loaded by plugin
    # Default: false
    Enabled: false

    # Display name of voting site
    Name: 'ExampleVoteSite'

    # Priority of this site
    # Used for sorted list
    # High priority, higher on the list
    Priority: 5

    # If true, votesite will be hidden from some GUI's, similar to being disabled
    Hidden: false

    # The serviceName from the vote, has to be correct to work correctly
    # Gotten from voting on the site (will be in console/log)
    # Usually is the main part of the url(e.g. PlanetMinecraft.com), but not always
    # See console when you vote (it will notify you if the plugin didn't find a votingsite matching the service site)
    ServiceSite: 'PlanetMinecraft.com'

    # Vote url for /vote
    # Format for this can be set in Config.yml
    # Do not include colors here
    # If you need to force a url set the url as this:
    # VoteURL: '[Text="ANY TEXT TO CLICK ON HERE",url="URLHERE"]'
    VoteURL: 'link to vote URL here, used in /vote'

    # Time between votes in hours (used for /vote next)

    # If true, rewards can be executed offline (requires ForceOffline to be true in the reward)
    # Setting this to true will execute the reward offline while the player is offline
    # This basically disables offline voting if set to true, don't misinterpret this option
